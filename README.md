INET Framework for OMNEST/OMNeT++ - GPL licensed components
===========================================================

The [INET framework](https://inet.omnetpp.org) is an open-source communication networks
simulation package, written for the OMNEST/OMNeT++ simulation system. This is a repository
containing models that were once part of INET, but cannot be included in the base INET
repo any longer because they are GPL licensed (as opposed to INET which is under LGPL).

You must have a properly built INET framework installed along this model under the `../inet`
directory (or change the INET_PROJ variable in the main Makefile if the directory name is different).

Contributions are highly welcome. You can make a difference!
